      <h2>Welcome to <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is a web-application and
persistence framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web-applications according to the Model-View-Control
pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also called the
presentation) into &quot;dumb&quot; templates that are primarily
responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model
contains the &quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account, Product,
Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist
themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests
(such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the
model and directing data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, the model is handled by
what&#8216;s called an object-relational mapping layer entitled Active
Record. This layer allows you to present the data from database rows as
objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You
can read more about Active Record in <a
href="vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. You can
read more about Action Pack in <a
href="vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Zoomify Information</h2>
<p>
The Zoomify application requires the most up-to-date version of <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> possible. The server must have at
least <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 1.2.3 to support this
application.
</p>
<p>
Only certain users are allowed to hold accounts and login to the system.
These users are defined in /config/allowed_users.txt. There is also an
emergency backup list in /config/environments/zoomify_environment.rb. Users
in this array can login even if they&#8216;re not listed in
allowed_users.txt.
</p>
<p>
The files for the slides are stored in /public/z_images/. The Zoomify tiles
are located in a folder with the ID of the slide in the database. Their
corresponding XML files (containing annotations) are in xml/ in a file with
the ID of the slide in the database. Finally, the original .zip file is
stored in zips/.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Web Servers</h2>
<p>
By default, <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will try to use
Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will use the WEBrick, the webserver
that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server, <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will check if Mongrel exists, then
lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures that you can always
get up and running quickly.
</p>
<p>
Mongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C-component (which requires
compilation) that is suitable for development and deployment of <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> applications. If you have Ruby Gems
installed, getting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem
install mongrel</tt>. More info at: <a
href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org">mongrel.rubyforge.org</a>
</p>
<p>
If Mongrel is not installed, <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will
look for lighttpd. It&#8216;s considerably faster than Mongrel and WEBrick
and also suited for production use, but requires additional installation
and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged to
start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can
download it from <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">www.lighttpd.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will use the built-in Ruby web
server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for
development, but not for production.
</p>
<p>
But of course its also possible to run <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> on any platform that supports FCGI.
Apache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI, please
visit: <a
href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI">wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI</a>
</p>
<h2>Debugging <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
Have &quot;tail -f&quot; commands running on the server.log and
development.log. <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will
automatically display debugging and runtime information to these files.
Debugging info will also be shown in the browser on requests from
127.0.0.1.
</p>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>
Breakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client.
This means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code,
investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find(:all)
      breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things
like:
</p>
<p>
Executing breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot; at
&#8230;/webrick_server.rb:16 in &#8216;breakpoint&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,
       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects
actually work:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first
  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
  &gt;&gt; f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when you&#8216;re ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D
</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>
You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through
<tt>script/console</tt>. Here you&#8216;ll have all parts of the
application configured, just like it is when the application is running.
You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database.
Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development
environment. Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like
<tt>script/console production</tt>.
</p>
<p>
To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<tt>reload!</tt>

<h2>Description of contents</h2>
<p>
app
</p>
<pre>
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
</pre>
<p>
app/controllers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController
  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/models
</p>
<pre>
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/views
</p>
<pre>
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.rhtml for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby
  syntax.
</pre>
<p>
app/views/layouts
</p>
<pre>
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common
  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the
  &lt;tt&gt;layout :default&lt;/tt&gt; and create a file named default.rhtml. Inside default.rhtml,
  call &lt;% yield %&gt; to render the view using this layout.
</pre>
<p>
app/helpers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated
  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to
  wrap functionality for your views into methods.
</pre>
<p>
config
</p>
<pre>
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.
</pre>
<p>
